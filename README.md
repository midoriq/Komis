# Car lot project
Jest to projekt szkolny nad którym pracowałam w zespole dwuosobowym. Moją częścią był głównie backend napisany w PHP, stworzenie bazy danych oraz pomoc przy frontendzie. 
This is school project on which I work in group of two. My part was mainly back-end written in PHP, creating and connecting with database, and help with front-end.

## Project description
The user is able to see car lot offers only after logging in. They can see offers, and sort by attributes like price, brand, or color. After 10 minutes of inaction, a user is automatically logged out. 
Super users are able to also add new cars to the database and delete them. 
Every logged-in user can see their profile and change things or add them.
